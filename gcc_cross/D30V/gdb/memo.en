I worked for

  1. running the program which locates a few nop at address 0x100
     under control d30v-elf-gdb.

  2. running the program which is generated by my own cc1 model.

  3. running the program which is generated by original cc1.

  4. calling function from d30v-elf-gdb command line


I uploaded d30v-tdep.c at this point as `d30v-tdep.c.002' and

gdb-10.2.d30v-elf/sim/d30v

as `d30v.2.tar'.
