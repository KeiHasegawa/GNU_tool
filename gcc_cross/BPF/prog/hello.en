I created "hello world" program. But it did not work.
For a piece of code:

	call	main

bpf-as doesn't generate correct object code.
And more,

	call	0x140

for above, program execution doesn't reach to `main'. This instruction
is treated as if it is `nop'.

I wondered why these tools were developed.
