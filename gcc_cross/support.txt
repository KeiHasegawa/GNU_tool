(*aarch64)    : gdb(simulator) fix, newlib fix are required.
(*alpha)      : `as' should be fix for assembly debugging. `gdb'
	        can be implemented with `SIMH'.
(*arm)        : gdb simulator part has to be developed separately.
(*arm)        : gcc-3.4.4 and newlib-1.13.0 are required.

(*d10v)       : gcc not supported.
(*i386)       : gdb simulator part has to be developed separately.
(*iq2000)     : ld fix is required for source level debugging.
                Refer to "IQ2000" and "IQ2000 source level debugging"
(*m32c)       : gcc fix is required. Refer to "M32C". Many tests don't pass.
(*m68hc11)    : gcc-3.4.4 and newlib-1.13.0 are required.
                gcc(runtime library) fix is required.

		Refer to "M68HC11" and "M68HC11 gdb"
		Many tests don't pass.
(*m68k)       : `gdb' can be implemented with `EASy68K'.
(*mcore)      : gdb fix is required. Refer to "MCORE gdb".
                gcc generates unexpected code for the function call which
		takes `long long' type argument. See also "MCORE" -> "ABI".
		Many tests don't pass.
(*microblaze) : gdb(simulator) fix is required.
(*mips)       : gcc-3.4.4 and newlib-1.13.0 are required.
