newlib install

As described at "BPF",  `configure' failed. I did the same thing with
"AVR programing":

% cd newlib-4.1.0.bpf
% gunzip -c newlib-Makefile.tar.gz | tar xvf -
% make -f Makefile.mine
% make -f Makefile.mine install

I noticed that `bfp-gcc' made errors for the well-formed program, so that
I chosed source files that `bfp-gcc' accepted.
