ETRAX CRIS cross compile environment

(*1) ETRAX CRIS

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETRAX_CRIS

(*2) Install with script


Use the same script with "IQ2000":

set TARGET = cris-elf  # Change

(*3) Verification => Refer to "EXTRA CRIS gdb".

Unfortunately, cris-elf-gdb doesn't recognize `target sim' command.

=> Refer to "EXTRA CRIS gdb". gdb fix was required. I confirmed that
   "hello world" program worked well.
