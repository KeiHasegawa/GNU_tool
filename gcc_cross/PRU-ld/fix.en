pru-elf-ld bug fix.

Omitted precisely. I fixed like below:

binutils-2.36.1.pru-elf/bfd/elf32-pru.c:

#if 0
  if (shrinked_insn_address >= start_address
      && shrinked_insn_address <= end_address)
#else
  if (shrinked_insn_address == start_address || 
      end_address - start_address > 4)
#endif
