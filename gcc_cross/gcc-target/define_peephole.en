define_peephole

According to gcc-10.2.0/gcc/rtl.def, we should use `define_peephole2'.

But anyway, I tried like below:

(define_peephole
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "nonimmediate_operand" "")
	(match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
  ""
  "peephole %0, %1")

And envoked `cc1' with `-O1' or `-O2' or `-O3', above was applied
for 4 bytes assign(move).
