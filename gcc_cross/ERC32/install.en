ERC32 cross compile environment

(*1) ERC32

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC32

(*2) Install with script

Use the same script with "IQ2000":

set TARGET = erc32-elf   # Change

But at binutils-2.36.1 install, configure failed.

At binutils-2.36.1/cpu directory, no erc32.cpu or no erc32.opc.
It seemes that for the first place, these tools are not developed.
