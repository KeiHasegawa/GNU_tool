(*1) Fix simulator

I noticed that simple assembler program could not be debug correctly.
I examined and found that program entry point was not set to program counter.

I fixed like below:

gdb-10.2.ft32-elf/sim/ft32/interp.c

#if 0  
  cpu->state.regs[FT32_HARD_SP] = addr;
#else
  cpu->state.pc = addr;
#endif

I thought this worked well. But still ft32-elf-gdb did not work.


% ft32-elf-addr2line -a 0x100 -e test000.elf

All instructions line information is `3'.

It's different from others somewhat.
