ia64-elf-gdb <-> ski

I did work so that ia64-elf-gdb could connect IA64 simulator, ski.
As a result, a simple program like below:

int f(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}

int main()
{
  return f(5, 6);
}

could be executed under control of ia64-elf-gdb.
At this point

/media/ca850f52-0605-42a7-9fd4-899de9edf461/work/GNU_LANG/gdb-12.1.ia64-elf/sim/ia64/

is uploaded as `ia64.3.tar'.

ia64-tdep.c is uploaded as `ia64-tdep.c.1' and

ski source is uploaded as `ski.1.tar'.
