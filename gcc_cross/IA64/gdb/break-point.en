I created the simple program like below:

int f(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}

int main()
{
  return f(5, 6);
}

And built like below:

% ia64-elf-gcc -o test.o test.c -g -c
% ia64-elf-ld -o test.elf ../default.o test.o -T ../default.x

where, ../default.o was startup routine.

Then executed test.elf under control of ia64-elf-gdb like below:

% cat gdbcom.2
set prompt (ia64-elf-gdb) 
target sim
load
sim memory-fill 0xcc
sim memory-region 0xe00,0x208
b main
run
quit
% ia64-elf-gdb -q -x gdbcom.2 test.elf

Note that the address of break-point of `main' is 0x1d1 => (*1)

So, before break-point working, I fixed like below:

extern "C"
void execute_for_me(SIM_DESC sd, sim_cpu* cpu, uint32_t tmp, sim_cia cia)
{
...
  if (insn[1] == 0x3333300) {
    cpu->psr |= (1 << 24) | (1 << 13) ;
    cpu->pc += 1;
    sim_engine_halt(sd, cpu, 0, cpu->pc, sim_stopped, SIM_SIGTRAP);
  }

By above fix, simulator part became to be able to detect break instruction.
But at this point, ia64-elf-gdb could not work well. => (*2)
Stopped source line should be test.c:8, not test.c:7.

After simulator detected the break instruction, simulator answered
that its `pc' was 0x1d1 not 0x1d0. And if it was accepted by ia64-elf-gdb,
ia64-elf-gdb might say that the target program stopped at test.c:8.
But currently ia64-elf-gdb say that the target program stopped at test.c:7
because ia64-elf-gdb recognized that the target program stopped at address
0x1d0, not 0x1d1.

Here, `test.elf' line information was:

% ia64-elf-addr2line -a 0x1d0 -e test.elf
0x00000000000001d0
/home/khasegawa/lang/53_GNU_tool/gcc_cross/IA64/test/test002/test.c:7
% ia64-elf-addr2line -a 0x1d1 -e test.elf
0x00000000000001d1
/home/khasegawa/lang/53_GNU_tool/gcc_cross/IA64/test/test002/test.c:8
%

So, I tried to investigate the reason why ia64-elf-gdb recognized the target
program stopped at address 0x1d0.
