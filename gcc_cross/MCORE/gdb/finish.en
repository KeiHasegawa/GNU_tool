finish command investigation.

Omitted precidely, mcore-elf-gcc doesn't generate .debug_frame section
correctly.

I created expected compile result and built test program for `finish' command.

Now I could confirmed that `finish' command worked well.
I up-loaded mcore-tdep.c a this point as `mcore-tdep.c.003' on this web page.
