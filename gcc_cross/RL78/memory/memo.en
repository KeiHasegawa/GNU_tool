RL78 simulator memory

statically 1 Mbytes memory is allocated.

#define MEM_SIZE 0x100000

/* Only for cpu.c to use.  */
extern unsigned char memory[];

Except above, while loading target program, allocate memory by applying
`memory.diff'.

As this result, memory will be allocated for `.text', `.rodata', `.data'
and `.bss' section.

Users have to assign memory for stack.
