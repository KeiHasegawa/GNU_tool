`finish' command at function which returns structure type. 

I noticed that some `gdb's `finish' command did not work
when I implemented pru-elf-gdb `finish' command.

(aarch64-elf-gdb) finish
Run till exit from #0  f () at test014.c:7
main () at test014.c:14
Value returned has type: struct S. Cannot determine contents
(aarch64-elf-gdb)



aarch64-elf-gdb : NG (OK if less than or equal to 16 bytes)
arm-elf-gdb     : NG
h8300-elf-gdb   : NG
pru-elf-gdb     : OK (implemented)
