Omitted precisely, I noticed that finish command worked well by below:

gdb-10.2.cr16-elf/sim/cr16/simops.c:5128
#if 0	
	switch (FUNC)
#else
	switch (7777)
#endif	  
	  {

By above fix, `cr16_return_value' is called when `finish' command is
executed.

I up-loaded `cr16-tdep.c' at this point as `cr16-tdep.c' on this web page.
