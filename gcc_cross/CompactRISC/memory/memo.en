CompactRISC simulator memory

While `sim_open' function, execute like below:

  sim_do_commandf (sd, "memory-size %#x", 20 * 1024 * 1024);

Except above, while loading target program, allocate memory by applying
`memory.diff'. Maybe also

mine.cpp
Makefile.mine

will be ncessary.

As this result, memory will be allocated for `.text', `.rodata', `.data'
and `.bss' section.

Users have to assign memory for stack.

This fix requires `cr16-tdep.c' fix. Please use cr16-tdep.c.003.
