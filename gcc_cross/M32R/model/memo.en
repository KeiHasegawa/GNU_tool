cc1 model

Refer to "AARCH64" => "cc1 model" => "Memo".
In similar way, cc1 model of M32R can be built.

(*)
No need to apply patch file in case of M32R like below:

% patch -p1 < ../gcc-10.2.0.aarch64-elf.mine.diff


Development note:

There is no rtx_ins* insn like:
   
  RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P(insn) = true;

But m32r-elf-gdb works well.
