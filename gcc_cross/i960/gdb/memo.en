I am still working for:

  1. running the program which locates a few nop at address 0x100
     under control z8k-coff-gdb.

  2. ....

I uploaded i960-tdep.c at this point as `i960-tdep.c.001',

gdb-10.2.i960-elf/sim/i960

as `i960.2.tar',

gdb-10.2.i960-elf/bfd

as `bfd.tar' and

gdb-10.2.i960-elf/opcodes

as `opcodes.tar'.
