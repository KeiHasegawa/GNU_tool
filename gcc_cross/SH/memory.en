SH simulator memory

While `sim_load' is called, `sim_write' is called and just onece, executed
like below:

  saved_state.asregs.memory =
    (unsigned char *) mcalloc (1, saved_state.asregs.msize);

where, saved_state.asregs.msize = 0x40000000. i.e.
[0, 0x40000000) area is allocated.

Except above, by applying `memory.diff' on this web page, allocate memory
for `.text', `.rodata', `.data' and `.bss' section.

Users have to assign memory for stack.
