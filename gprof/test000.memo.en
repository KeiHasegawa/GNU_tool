Introduction of gprof 

      Compile using gcc with `-pg' option:

% gcc -pg -o test000 test000.c test000_0.c test000_1.c test000_2.c

      You may be interrested with some stuff. But this is just introduction.
      We'll investigate precicely later.
      
% ./test000 1 2000 300000
f called with 1000
g called with 2000000
h called with 300000000
% ls gmon.out
gmon.out   # `gmon.out' is generated
% gprof test000 gmon.out > test000.gprof

      Now look at text file `test000.gprof'.
