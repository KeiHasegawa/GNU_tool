configure: error: Package requirements (xproto >= 7.0.17 xextproto xtrans xcb >= 1.11.1 kbproto inputproto) were not met:

Package 'xtrans', required by 'virtual:world', not found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables X11_CFLAGS
and X11_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.

./configure command failed like above. From just above information,
a package named

xtrans

was not found.

By the way, I found the important fact from executed ./configure:

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
cat >config.log <<_ACEOF

_ACEOF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This'll cause to write something into config.log. I confirmed the head of
config.log:

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I see. Then I searched the current error from config.log and found below:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And more, I could also find:

PKG_CONFIG='/usr/bin/pkg-config'

Unfortunately I could not get any information about `X11_REQUIRES'
From these, I guessed that command was executed like below:

/usr/bin/pkg-config --exists --print-errors "$X11_REQUIRES"

but it failed and the variable `X11_REQUIRES' value was not still clear.
Now investigate executed configure especially correspond line.
From config.log, configure:21531 is related with this error. And
the part was:

    { { $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: \$PKG_CONFIG --exists --print-errors \"\$X11_REQUIRES\""; } >&5

From this part, I was just able to know the variable `X11_REQUIRES'
was used but the value was not still clear.
I seached `X11_REQUIRES' from exected configure, and found below:

X11_REQUIRES='xproto >= 7.0.17 xextproto xtrans xcb >= 1.11.1'
...
   X11_REQUIRES="${X11_REQUIRES} kbproto inputproto"

i.e. I guessed that below was executed:

/usr/bin/pkg-config --exists --print-errors 'xproto >= 7.0.17 xextproto xtrans xcb >= 1.11.1 kbproto inputproto'

but it failed. Now acutally I executed:

% /usr/bin/pkg-config --exists --print-errors 'xproto >= 7.0.17 xextproto xtrans xcb >= 1.11.1 kbproto inputproto'
Package xtrans was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `xtrans.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
Package 'xtrans', required by 'virtual:world', not found
%

Someway this is right answer. 
In fact, before executing ./configure, I've alread installed `xtrans'.
Acutually the next file exists:

/usr/local/share/pkgconfig/xtrans.pc

So, all I have to is let /usr/bin/pkg-config to know the above file
position (may be directory). Again return to first message:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH

I noticed that the environment variable was not set suitablly.

% printenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Nothing to be set.

% setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/local/share/pkgconfig:/usr/share/pkgconfig
% /usr/bin/pkg-config --exists --print-errors 'xproto >= 7.0.17 xextproto xtrans xcb >= 1.11.1 kbproto inputproto'
%

Now command successed at this time.
