Evaluate Lisp expression

M-x load-file

is deescribed at "BackSpace key". This can load the specified file
and if it contains Lisp expressions, they are evaluated.

There are other ways for evaluating. For example,
place cursor the last ) of below Lisp expression and
C-x C-e:

(global-set-key "\C-h" 'help-command)

This causes aganin BackSpace key is bind to help-command.

After executing emacs, shows the buffer list by C-x C-b.
You can notice that

    *scratch*               145 Lisp Interaction

scratch buffer exists. In this buffer, you can evaluate Lisp expression.
For example, at scratch buffer

(+ 1 2 3 4)

place cursor at the last ) and press C-j. You can confirm the expression
is evalueated.
