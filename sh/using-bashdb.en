I tried to execute like below:

% bashdb sample000.txt aaa bbb ccc ddd

and it worked.

I wondered that above was same with below:

% bash --debugger sample000.txt aaa bbb ccc ddd

I could not judge at that point. Anyway,

step execution available
variable can be printed
breakpoint can be set

At cygwin, bashdb outputs error message like below:

/usr/local/share/bashdb/command/source.sh: line 41: /dev/stdin: No such file or directory

But it worked in its own way.
